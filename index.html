				<p>Learning Swift and X-code, Xcode is the studio for me.  I love the drag/drop and visual aspects of it.  Swift itself has been tricky.  Not completey different from Javascript but the syntax is always a hurdle to jump through.  Optionals are the biggest change for me.  But with everything practice is what matters.  Everyday learning is the greatest, each day I get to find a new tool and add it to my arsenal.</p>

				<p>     Prime was an experience of a lifetime, for those that don’t know Prime Digital Academy is a coding-bootcamp.  A 20 week program that builds students into full-stack-software-engineers.  It is incredibly intense and thoroughly crams technology knowledge into every byte of space on your mental hard drive (and some of your HDD).  It was the fastest summer of my life, the weeks flew by.  I learned multiple front and back-end languages HTML/CSS, Javascript, Angular, Node.js, SQL, Bootstrap, and many more.  Prime was absolutely incredible, I had some of the most intelligent, and downright thought-provoking instructors(Chris Black and Kris Szafranski).</br>
					I built real world applications on my own, and as part of a team. Solo: <a href="https://whatdaywhen.herokuapp.com/#/home">WhatDay.When??</a>, Group: <a href="https://github.com/teamvanguard/vanguard">Vanguard Tech</a>.  The solo project tested my brain power, internal motivation, and creativity.  It was the most important project I’d ever done…Until the group project.  The group work was on a whole other level, I was pushed to use everything I knew from my solo project as well as learning to be a part of a collaboration.  I have never been more proud of a project.  In all of coding, or schooling, or work anything.  Our VT-Rewards application and the presentation of it was immaculate.  I am so proud to be a part of that team...Prime is amazing.</p>
